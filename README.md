# label-helper
Node.js app for labelling data, made for my Bachelor's thesis work. It loads up a time series, displays it and allows you to click through it, marking any characteristic spots. Those are recorded and saved to a file for further processing.

## Usage

To use, just clone the repository and run `npm install` in its root, and then run the `app.js` file (for example by running `node app.js`). Then you can navigate to `localhost:1337` in your browser to use the app.
