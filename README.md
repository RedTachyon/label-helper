# label-helper
Node app for labelling data

## Usage

To use, just clone the repository and run `npm install` in its root, and then run the `app.js` file (for example by running `node app.js`). Then you can navigate to `localhost:1337` in your browser to use the app.

The app is still in an early stage of the development, but you should be able to see a nice looking graph.
